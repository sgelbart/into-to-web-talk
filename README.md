# HTML
- `<h1>This is a heading!</h1>`
- `<p>This is a paragraph!</p>`
- simple to learn 
- `<p class=".a-custom-label" id="anotherCustomLabel">This is a paragraph!</p>`
- (classes and IDs are custom lables that we use so we can reference it in other code)
- can get crazy...but foundation is same...

# CSS
- `p {background-color: purple}`
- `.a-custom-label {background-color: blue}`
- harness your artistic side!
